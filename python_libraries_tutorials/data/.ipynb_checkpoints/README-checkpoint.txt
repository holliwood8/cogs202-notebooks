The input data comprises clinically relevant variables for thousands of patients collected as part of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). 
Some useful variables to know are: 
Mini Mental State Examination score (MMSE), Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS13), and head size-
normalized volume of the brain ventricles (ventricles).
Not all of the imaging data was necessarily collected, which is why the data can contain lots of NaN volumes.
Several measures were extracted from the MRI images including the volumes for several brain regions. 
APOE4 variable reflects whether the patients contained a copy of the APOE4 gene factor or not.
